## 🚀 Overview

**ZK Infinita Carbon** is a fully decentralized, on-chain platform for carbon credit generation, verification, trading, and community-driven governance. Built with **zero-knowledge proofs**, **smart contracts**, and **IPFS**, the platform enables transparent and trustworthy climate finance — without compromising sensitive data.

Designed specifically for the **Crypto Cities Hackathon**, it empowers digital-native communities to take charge of their environmental impact using the same civic infrastructure that governs their economies and identity.

## 🧱 Core Features

### ✅ Carbon Credit Lifecycle

1. **Submit Claim**  
   - Add geo-location, time window, carbon reduction amount, and IPFS hash of supporting docs.
   - Generate and attach a ZK proof for private verification.

2. **Community Voting**  
   - Claims are visible to the public.
   - Verified users vote to approve or reject based on transparency and evidence.

3. **Mint & Trade**  
   - Upon successful voting and ZK verification, credits are minted as ERC-20 tokens.
   - Users can list credits for sale in a decentralized marketplace.

---

### 🗳️ On-Chain Claim Voting

Each carbon claim is subject to **public governance**:

- Voters cast their decision on-chain (For or Against).
- If the majority approves, the credits are minted.
- Votes and results are immutable and public — building accountability and community trust.

---

## 🔐 Zero-Knowledge Proof System

We use SNARK-based zero-knowledge proofs to:

- Verify eligibility without exposing:
  - Emissions data
  - Credit history
  - Exact project methodology

This allows climate contributors to **prove their impact** while retaining **competitive and privacy-sensitive information**.

## 🧠 Why It Stands Out

| Feature                       | Traditional Systems             | ZK Infinita Carbon                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Verification                 | Centralized auditors             | ZK-proofs verified on-chain           |
| Claim Evaluation             | Manual, opaque                   | Community voting + verifiable proof   |
| Data Privacy                 | Risk of exposure                 | Full privacy via ZK-SNARKs            |
| Transparency                 | Siloed, off-chain registries     | All actions on-chain + IPFS           |
| Trading Mechanism            | Closed marketplaces              | Open ERC-20 & decentralized trading   |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Base Sepolia (EVM-compatible testnet)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Verifier, Token, Marketplace)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (deployed on Vercel)
- **Storage**: IPFS (file-based claim evidence)
- **ZK Proofs**: SNARK-based off-chain generation, on-chain verification
- **Voting System**: On-chain community approval logic via smart contracts

## 🧪 Sample Workflow

1. Submit claim via frontend with geolocation + IPFS hash.
2. Generate a ZK proof off-chain and send it along with the claim.
3. Wait for community voting period to complete.
4. If approved, credits are minted and added to user's wallet.
5. User can now list credits for sale on the integrated marketplace.

## 🏁 Final Note

> **ZK Infinita Carbon** represents the missing link between **climate finance** and **crypto-native governance**.  
> It brings **verifiability**, **transparency**, and **privacy** to the forefront of environmental impact — exactly what Network States need to thrive.

Let’s build cities that are **carbon-conscious**, **privacy-respecting**, and **community-governed** — one proof at a time. 🌍🔐🌱
